## The Problem

### Problem Scope 
- The rise in use of food delivery applications has translated to a fall in people patronising hawker centres and therefore, severely impacted the livelihood of hawkers

- Due to efforts to minimise physical contact, there has been a decrease in the number of volunteers to hand out food to underprivileged households which has had an impact on food drives and the operations of food charities

### Target Audience
- Benefactor: General public who have the willingness to donate and help the less privileged but are constrained by time or want to minimise contact with other people during this pandemic.
- Beneficiary: Financially underprivileged people who struggle to afford meals daily which could be due to unstable incomes  and unemployment. The Covid-19 pandemic is likely to have contributed to this number. 

## Our Solution
### 1. Do Social Good from the Comfort of Your Home
Provide an online platform called “TAKE” to allow members of the public to pay in advance for meals at hawker centres which can then be claimed at a later time by those who are unable to afford a meal 

### 2. Reduce Hunger
This platform “digitalizes” food donations and ensures that underprivileged families can receive their meals despite Covid-19 restrictions and the labour crunch 

### 3. Directs Traffic to Hawker Centres
Through the platform, hawker centres may also enjoy higher profits and greater footfall as there will be individuals visiting hawker stalls to redeem the meals which have been donated 

## Technical Details
